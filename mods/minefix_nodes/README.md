# Minefixnodes

This mod adds missing items and blocks from Minecraft to Minetest

## Installation notes

Before running this mod, you have to add your own textures. For legal reasons we can't offer existing textures from Minecraft, and we're not yet offering our own.
Place all your textures in `textures/`.

The following is a list of required textures and their file names:

* minefix_nodes_andesite.png
* minefix_nodes_andesite_polished.png
* minefix_nodes_diorite.png
* minefix_nodes_diorite_polished.png
* minefix_nodes_granite.png
* minefix_nodes_granite_polished.png
