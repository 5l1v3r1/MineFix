# MineFix

MineFix is a project that tries to (slowly) implement all missing features from the game [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) to [Minetest](https://minetest.net). It does this by adding new mods that supply missing blocks and items, and removing non-Minecraft features from the base Minetest game.

Note that we are **not** trying to be compatible with existing mods and modpacks. Mods will have to be made compatible with this subgame instead.

Join the development on #minefix on Snoonet (IRC), or #minefix:matrix.org (Matrix)!

## Installation instructions

Copy or clone this repository to `~/.minetest/games/minefix`.
Make sure you run a copy of Minetest compiled after the 22nd of March. The stable build lacks a feature we require, so you'll have to compile from source for now.

Once installed, select the Minefix subgame, create a world, and start playing!
