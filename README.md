# MineFix

MineFix is a project that tries to (slowly) implement all missing features from the game [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) to [Minetest](https://minetest.net). It does this by adding new mods that supply missing blocks and items, and removing non-Minecraft features from the base Minetest game.

Note that we are **not** trying to be compatible with existing mods and modpacks. Mods will have to be made compatible with this subgame instead.
