# MineFix

MineFix is a project that tries to (slowly) implement all missing features from the game [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) to [Minetest](https://minetest.net). It does this by adding new mods that supply missing blocks and items, and removing non-Minecraft features from the base Minetest game.

## Installation instructions

Copy or clone this repository to `minetestdirectory/games/minefix`.
Now go into the `minefix/mods` directory and read every README.md for every mod starting with `minefix` in the name for any further installation instructions.
